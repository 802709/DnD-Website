            <h2>Overview of Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
            
            <p>Dungeons and Dragons has been around a long time, with the first edition having been officially released in 1974 by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. Over the decades, DnD has most certainly gotten famous, sparking the rise in popularity of tabletop gaming over the following decades. In DnD's case, the name of the game is tabletop roleplay - in essence, the game is built upon a group of people, each of whom create characters and act under the role of said characters as they partake in a fantasy adventure built upon shared imagination.</p>
            
            <p>This group can be split into two main roles - the 'players' and the 'Dungeon Master' (DM for short).</p>
            
            <p>The majority of participants in a game of DnD are these 'players'. These people a each create a character and act like thier characters during the game. These characters act as a group of adventurers, and serve as the main characters of the adventure(s) the DM throws at them. Although complex, the system(s) in place for DnD allow for the creation of a wide breadth of characters with a truly massive amount of options for abilities and traits. Each edition of DnD has a somewhat diffrent take on the system, but at thier core they all provide a lot of options. For 5th Edition (often referred to as '5e'), character creation is based around a number of key choices for each character - <u> class, race (species), alignment and ability scores</u>, as well as spells, items, and backstory elements - each of which will be described in more detail in thier own sections.  Player creation can be daunting at first, but with time and learning, the system becomes increasingly intuitive. </p>
            <p>Although they make up a minority of those playing DnD, Dungeon Masters have the biggest roles of everyone in the game. Ironically, the DM is never physically present inside the imagined, fictional world of the game - they do not make and act as a single character like the others. Rather, the DM is the vessel of the adventure - they are everything else besides the player characters. They build the world and locations that the characters can explore, they are the orchestrators of every event not directly caused by the player characters. They are the primary deliverers of the information needed to imagine and get immersed into the adventure - a major part of thier job is to verbally describe the world and the events of an adventure to the rest of the group. They also determine the consequences of characters' actions and plan for the future of the adventure both during and outside the game.</p> <p>Although this may sound like it takes a lot of preparation, the reality is that much of what the DM does is often improvised during the game, and the DM's creations are not always set down to the last details. In fact, it's often a great strategy for DMs to NOT plan in excruciating detail. After all, they are not the only ones at the table! The players all individually and mutually have power to make thier own decisions and take thier own actions inside the fantasy world - which must be accounted for. Even if a DM is playing with a group of people they know very well, they still can't rely on predicting what the players will do at every junction and fully depend on one rigid plotlines. To account for the will of the players, the world and plot should be flexible, which entails much of the improvisation that DMs partake in. </p>
            <p> Physically, there may not be a whole lot going on in DnD. Only a few essentials are really needed - just a few sets of many-sided dice, some pencils and paper to keep track of changes to character attribues (such as getting and losing items or health points), some reference material (in needed), and some kind of divider for the DM to keep thier plans secret from the players. Once everyone is good and settled with what they need, the adventure can begin!</p>

           <h2> DnD: The Making of An Adventurer </h2>
            <p> As mentioned previously, there are a lot of components that go into making a character - however, there seem to be just four 'cornerstone' choices to be made in the end, while the other details tend to take less emphasis and can usually be decided quicker. These four cornerstones to making a character are class, race, alignment, and ability scores.</p>

         <h3>Class</h3>
             <p class="p2">
             Character classes in Dungeons and Dragons are a major part of the game, as they essentially determine a noticable amount of what your character can do ability-wise and what powers they can unlock in the future. In some ways, each charater class is like the style by which you'd play other games. What class you pick, in a nutshell, is similar to choosing a certain weapon to go into a fight with. Classes also help shape the 'flavor' of adventurers - they can help create a sense of mystery, sociability, awe, piety, or anything else one wishes. In 5th Edition, there is a list from 12 character classes to choose from - each of which provides great depth an options available for character creation and progression worthy of thier own summaries and explanations. You can find that page by clicking <a class ="a2" href = "dndclasses.html"> here. </a> While deciding classes, one simple question can also help narrow down the options to choose from - ask yourself -"How much magic do I want to use?" This question can essentially be answered with 'a lot', 'some', and 'not at all', with there being multiple options for each answer.

         <h3>Race</h3>
             <p class="p3">
             In Dungeons and Dragons, the word 'race' not usually used to decribe the ethnicity or skin color on a given group of people - after all, DnD does not deal with just one kind of 'people' like the real world does. Rather, it is synonymous with the word 'species' - describing the physical makeup of various creature, tendences and ablities they may have, and a little bit of unique cultural ideas and traditions that could have an impact on thier beliefs or ways of living. These species vary greatly with the extience of many diffrent humaniods running around. Races in DnD range from very human-like creatures such as elves, dwarves, and gnomes to creatures with clearer inhuman traits like dragonborns, devil-decended tieflings, and half-orcs. Many diffrent sources also provide a large list of further options, both official and custom (or in DnD terms, 'homebrew'). Each race has a few abilities unique to themselves, as well as thier own affects on ability scores. A further list of the more commonly used races and descriptions of them can be found <a class ="a2" href = "races.html"> here. </a>

         <h3>Alignment</h3>
             <p class="p2">
            Alignment can often be a tricky thing to define, as it's mostly an abstract, widly-encompassing concept and isn't really any sort of 'thing' in DnD worlds like, say, a magical object or a character's name might be.
