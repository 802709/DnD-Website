            <h2>Overview of Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
            
            <p>Dungeons and Dragons has been around a long time, with the first edition having been officially released in 1974 by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. Over the decades, DnD has most certainly gotten famous, sparking the rise in popularity of tabletop gaming over the following decades. In DnD's case, the name of the game is tabletop roleplay - in essence, the game is built upon a group of people, each of whom create characters and act under the role of said characters as they partake in a fantasy adventure built upon shared imagination.</p>
            
            <p>This group can be split into two main roles - the 'players' and the 'Dungeon Master' (DM for short).</p>
            
            <p>The majority of participants in a game of DnD are these 'players'. These people a each create a character and act like thier characters during the game. These characters act as a group of adventurers, and serve as the main characters of the adventure(s) the DM throws at them. Although complex, the system(s) in place for DnD allow for the creation of a wide breadth of characters with a truly massive amount of options for abilities and traits. Each edition of DnD has a somewhat diffrent take on the system, but at thier core they all provide a lot of options. For 5th Edition (often referred to as '5e'), character creation is based around a number of key choices for each character - <u> class, race (species), alignment and ability scores</u>, as well as spells, items, and backstory elements - each of which will be described in more detail in thier own sections.  Player creation can be daunting at first, but with time and learning, the system becomes increasingly intuitive. </p>
            <p>Although they make up a minority of those playing DnD, Dungeon Masters have the biggest roles of everyone in the game. Ironically, the DM is never physically present inside the imagined, fictional world of the game - they do not make and act as a single character like the others. Rather, the DM is the vessel of the adventure - they are everything else besides the player characters. They build the world and locations that the characters can explore, they are the orchestrators of every event not directly caused by the player characters. They are the primary deliverers of the information needed to imagine and get immersed into the adventure - a major part of thier job is to verbally describe the world and the events of an adventure to the rest of the group. They also determine the consequences of characters' actions and plan for the future of the adventure both during and outside the game.</p> <p>Although this may sound like it takes a lot of preparation, the reality is that much of what the DM does is often improvised during the game, and the DM's creations are not always set down to the last details. In fact, it's often a great strategy for DMs to NOT plan in excruciating detail. After all, they are not the only ones at the table! The players all individually and mutually have power to make thier own decisions and take thier own actions inside the fantasy world - which must be accounted for. Even if a DM is playing with a group of people they know very well, they still can't rely on predicting what the players will do at every junction and fully depend on one rigid plotlines. To account for the will of the players, the world and plot should be flexible, which entails much of the improvisation that DMs partake in. </p>
            <p> Physically, there may not be a whole lot going on in DnD. Only a few essentials are really needed - just a few sets of many-sided dice, some pencils and paper to keep track of changes to character attribues (such as getting and losing items or health points), some reference material (in needed), and some kind of divider for the DM to keep thier plans secret from the players. Once everyone is good and settled with what they need, the adventure can begin!</p>

           <h2> DnD: The Making of An Adventurer </h2>
            <p> As mentioned previously, there are a lot of components that go into making a character - however, there seem to be just four 'cornerstone' choices to be made in the end, while the other details tend to take less emphasis and can usually be decided quicker. These four cornerstones to making a character are class, race, alignment, and ability scores. But what do any of these terms mean? Let's get into that.</p>
         <sub>
         <h3>Classes</h3>
             <p class="p2">
             Character classes in Dungeons and Dragons are a major part of the game, as they essentially determine a noticable amount of what your character can do ability-wise and what powers they can unlock in the future. In some ways, each charater class is like the style by which you'd play other games. What class you pick, in a nutshell, is similar to choosing a certain weapon to go into a fight with. Classes also help shape the 'flavor' of adventurers - they can help create a sense of mystery, sociability, awe, piety, or anything else one wishes. In 5th Edition, there is a list from 12 character classes to choose from - each of which provides great depth an options available for character creation and progression worthy of thier own summaries and explanations. You can find that page by clicking <a class ="a2" href = "dndclasses.html"> here. </a> While deciding classes, one simple question can also help narrow down the options to choose from - ask yourself -"How much magic do I want to use?" This question can essentially be answered with 'a lot', 'some', and 'not at all', with there being multiple options for each answer.

         <h3>Race</h3>
             <p class="p3">
             In Dungeons and Dragons, the word 'race' not usually used to decribe the ethnicity or skin color on a given group of people - after all, DnD does not deal with just one kind of 'people' like the real world does. Rather, it is synonymous with the word 'species' - describing the physical makeup of various creature, tendences and ablities they may have, and a little bit of unique cultural ideas and traditions that could have an impact on thier beliefs or ways of living. These species vary greatly with the extience of many diffrent humaniods running around. Races in DnD range from very human-like creatures such as elves, dwarves, and gnomes to creatures with clearer inhuman traits like dragonborns, devil-decended tieflings, and half-orcs. Many diffrent sources also provide a large list of further options, both official and custom (or in DnD terms, 'homebrew'). Each race has a few abilities unique to themselves, as well as thier own affects on ability scores. A further list of the more commonly used races and descriptions of them can be found <a class ="a2" href = "races.html"> here. </a>

         <h3>Alignment</h3>
             <p class="p2">
            Alignment can often be a tricky thing to define, as it's mostly an abstract, widly-encompassing concept and isn't really any sort of 'thing' in DnD worlds, unlike magicals object or character's names, enemies' health points, etc. The easiest way to describe what alignment is and how it affects the game is by thinking of a given creature's alignment as thier moral compass, something that influences thier thoughts, actions and personality to a noticable degree. But just like morality in real life, alignments in DnD are not black and white or set in stone - it's much more like a spectrum and where characters and creatures fall on it. A good way of thinking of the alignment system is by imagining two spectrums - one for 'good' and 'evil', and the other being for 'law' and 'chaos', with a 'neutral' in the middle of each. This results in nine diffrent alignment options; Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, and Lawful Evil - Neutral Good, True Neutral, and Neutral Evil - and Chaotic Good, Chaotic Neutral and Chaotic Evil. But what does any of this mean in DnD? 
             </p>
             <p class = "p2">'Good' is the most self-explanitory - to be 'good' is to be helpful and generally kind-natured (or at least try to be) in most situations. To be good is to also be considerate of others' thoughts and feelings, as well as how those things and thier lives would be affected by your actions. An adventurer wanting to help a simple farmer gather his scattered livestock for no paticular pay and without some ulterior, malicious motive would be considered good. A creature that has a habiat of giving charities in the form of useful goods or treasures would be considered good.  </p>
             <p class = "p2">'Evil' is simply the anthesis of good. To be evil is to be harmful. To be evil is to be intentionnaly cruel and oftentimes destructive in your words and actions - as well as to not care or even enjoy the pains you've caused others. Evil creatures are usually self-centered, but may also be willing servants of some other, greater evil. Any creature can do an evil act, but it's the extent of willingness and intention to take part in harmful acts - while knowing that the act is harmful - that defines whether the creature is ultimatly good, evil, or in between. A creature who wants to burn down an entire village or go on a wild killing spree 'just because' would be considered evil. A creature that wants to excessivley hurt torture another creature - even if it's for a logical reason like interrogating another evil creature - would likley be considered evil for the excessive harm they'd inflict. </p>
              <p class = "p2">'Law', when used to describe alignment, is some sort of reason, principle, structure, or ruling a creature follows. These 'laws' do not have to comply with any sort of city-state's or establishment's laws - they can (and ofteen do) vary greatly between individual creatures. A royal guard upholding and enforcing the state laws imposed by a noble would be considered lawful. A scientist who works only on things that seem logical and productive would be considered lawful. However, even creatures consistiently doing nonsensical things could also be considered lawful, assuming that whatever acts said creature is doing is considered as reasonable by the creature. For example, a cult follower could raid a village and sacrifice several of the villagers to whatever force or creature they're serving - even that could be considered lawful if the cult follower is under a belief like 'my deity rules over all - this is merely for a greater cause', or perhaps 'it is only reasonable to cut down wheat when its primed for harvest - why would this be any different?'...as long as a creature usually acts on the basis some kind of reason, principle, or logic, the creature and its habits could be considered lawful - even if this 'reason' is unconventional, bizzare, evil, or whatever else it may be.</p>
             <p class = "p2"> 'Chaos' is the opposition of law. To be chaotic is to be a rulebreaker, to be 'out of the box' in actions and thoughts. Chaotic creatures are often spontaneous, wild, capricacious, or fickle in nature. They also often have a noticable habiat of 'being all over the place', jumping from one idea to another in thier heads, and often acting on some or many of these thoughts - for this and/or other reasons, chaotic creatures don't tend to fall into routines easily. Chaotic creatures are inherntly the least predictable of all the alignments, and many have a tendency to be quite energetic and/or impulsive, jumping head-first into situations without a second thought or simply on the basis of 'why not!'. Such qualities often leads to funny and memorable moments happening out of the improvisation of the DM and/or a character's controller. A creature wanting to challenge an enemy to a dance-off, or just spontanously break-dancing in front of the enemy would be considered chaotic. A creature wanting to punch a random inanimate object for no paticular reason would be considered chaotic. A creature who wants to run around a town in the middle of the day whilst screaming loudly - not about anything, just to scream - would be considered chaotic. How chaotic creatures end up acting is as wild and varible as the limits of thier imaginaion.
                Some might say that to be chaotic is to be a fool - there's much that can counter such a claim. Intelligence, wisdom, or any other kind of 'smartness' doesn't prevent nor cause chaotic tendencies and natures. For example, imagine a passionate and renouned scientist jumping into researching a concept or material headfirst, and then ends up inventing a new innovation just from experimentation and sheer curiousity - that scientist, or least thier actions, would likley be considered chaotic.  </p>
             <p class = "spacer"> Hey look you found some hidden text - this is just a spacer. </p>
             <p class = "p2">Do note, though, that individual actions do not automatically define alignment. Alignments are like tendencies - NOT  a scrict code of conduct. Creatures and characters can be forced to act against thier nature, just like how people can act against thier morals and beliefs in real life. A good-aligned character could be persuaded or decieved into robbing a church's treasury if they are given explanation that the robbery would be for some greater good, even if said good doesn't exist. An evil-aligned character can be swayed into saving a group of helpless creatures from a deadly beast if they know or are convinced that there would be some personal gain in doing the act, such as getting paid in coins or treasures by the creatures. A lawful creature could be persuaded out of following thier usual principals and standards if they are given great enough incentive, whether that be fufillment, the feeling of having done something right or good, treasures, wealth, fitting in with a group - anything that would motivate the given character. A chaotic creature could be moved to follow a given set of rules or laws if a great enough force is presented, whether that force be peer pressure from the adventuring group, fear of social reprecussions, risk of mortal danger, or anything else that might persuade the character. In theory, any creature could be persuaded into acting against thier nature and morals if they would given a great enough reward or would be presented a sufficient enough danger or deterrent, or if thier own emotions pushed them to act out of thier usualy ways - it all depends on the individual creature(s) and the individual scenarios they end up in. </p> <p class = "p2">There might even be occasions where a character willingly and knowingly chooses to take an action that would probably be considered to be inconsiestient or even contridictary to thier usual behaviors. This kind of happening would most likley be done with some other goal or motive in mind, but it is also possible that a character just feels like trying something out simply out of curiousity or just for the sake of doing the act. That kind of thing happening on occasion is okay - remember, alignments are tendencies, not absolute law - but it also shouldn't happen excessivley unless a character is going through events or making realizations that would change thier personality and/or thinking, and thus moving thier alignment to a difrent point on the scales of Gooid-Evil and/or Law-Chaos. </p>
             <p class = "p2">Also, be sure to keep note that not all creatures within a given alignment are not the same either - the alignment system is like a set of spectrums, not like hard numbers in a binary. One good-aligned creature could easily be considered as much more good than another creature in the same alignment, and vice versa for evil, lawfulness, and chaotic leanings. For example, imagine two creatures of Chaotic Evil alignment. One is a kleptomanic and has a habiat of being mildly destructive in thier thieving actions - this creature thus tends to leave messes and breaks objects the in houses and streets they roam, but it's nothing exceptionally dangerous nor cruel-hearted, it's more so reckless actions driven by selfish greed. Then take the other chaotic evil creature - an infamous, ruthless criminal with a track record of setting fires that burn down entire villages and wandering the streets and alleyways of various citess, slaughtering any creature in thier path. This criminal also has a famous degree of vengefulness, as any who are foolish enough to get in the criminal's way are found in piles of near-unidentifiable vicera strewn about tools of torture. This villian, at least in thier acts of vengeance, acts out of some wildly malicious force, going to great lengths to make thier victims suffer. One of these creatures is more malicious, more destructive, and more evil than the other, but they are both still Chaotic Evil creatures nonetheless - one is just further on the 'evil' end of the spectrum than the other.</p> 
             
             <p class = "p2"> Neutrals on both spectrums also follow such a concept, in a sense. But instead of being more 'neutral' than another given creature, neutral-aligned characters are more so diffrentiated by how much they do or don't lean towards a given edge of one of the spectrums. For another example, imagine two more creatures, this time with Lawful Neutral alignments. One creature acts soley in the name of soceital order, serving as a prominent law enforcement officer in thier city of residence. This officer is known to do whatever it takes when it comes to catching a criminal and preventing future crimes - from chasing a criminal through a dangerous region of the city to jumping into action at the first sign of a robbery, but also from interrogating a person that was deemed as a suspicous suspect on a whim to killing a creature with a reputation of many crimes without proof or hesitation. Is the officer paticularly good or evil? It does not seem so, but how far they lean towards one end or another is unclear. Then imagine the other Lawful Neutral creature, a shop owner with high hopes for growing thier buisness. This shop owner is said to be stubborn when it comes to haggling prices - insisting that thier original prices were fair and ultimatley persuading those who initaited the haggling into paying more than they would have otherwise- all while giving no trouble and activley helping normal and returning customers. The shopkeeper also needs a signifigant amount of money to buy an empty building and refurnish it into a second storefront thier children could operate and make a living at - a need which has lead the shopkeeper to hire the children to loiter around the store as false attendents and pickpocket those who don't look interested in buying. So, is the shopkeeper paticularly good or evil? Just like the officer, the shopkeeper has some questionable practices, but also has and does noticable good as well - warrenting a place well in 'neutral' territory. But which creature is more good or evil than the other? That comes down to individual judgements.</p>
